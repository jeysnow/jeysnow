### Bit 'bout me
I'm a Brazilian doing my PhD research in Germany on organizational studies. It was in this context that I've got in contact with R and started tinkering with it. My previous coding experience was with C# and Unity, which I learned by mysself to replace another lecturer that left the college I was working on at the time. This page is a small portfolio, given that I have not yet worked as a dev in "the industry", but I have learned quite a few things online, inluding an indtroduction to ASP.NET.
